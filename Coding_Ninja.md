## Ninja And The Merged String  `Difficulty: EASY`

**Problem Statement**

Ninja has been given two strings ‘A’ and ‘B’ both of the same length, ‘N’, Now Ninja has been assigned a task to make another string 'C' consisting of the characters of the string 'A' and string 'B' alternatively from the first position of the string 'A'.
Ninja needs your help to create string 'C', the alternate merged string of the strings 'A' and string 'B'.

**Example:**
```
Input: 'N' = 3, 'A' ="abc", 'B' = "pqr"

Output: "apbqcr"

It is self-explanatory that the alternate merged string of the strings "abc" and "pqr" will be "apbqcr"
```

**Input Format:**
```
The first line of input contains an integer 'T', denoting the number of test cases. 

For each test case, the first line will contain integer 'N', the size of the input strings 'A' and 'B'. The second line will contain the string 'A' and the third line will contain the string 'B'.
```

**Output Format:**
```
For each test case, print only one line containing the merged string of the input strings 'A' and 'B'.
```

**Note:**
```
You don't need to print anything. It has already been taken care of. Just implement the given function.
```

**Constraints:**
```
1 <= 'T' <= 5
1 <= 'N' <= 10^5

Time Limit: 1 sec
```

**Sample Input 1:**

**Explanation Of Sample Input 1 :**
```
For the first test case, It is self-explanatory that the alternate merged string of the strings "abc" and "bbc" will be "abbbcc"

For the first second case, It is self-explanatory that the alternate merged string of the strings "xyxy" and "xyae" will be "xxyyxaye"
```

## Training `Difficulty: Medium`

**Problem Statement**

Ninja is given an array ‘A’ of size ‘N’ where each element defines the difficulty of the problem. He needs to find the number of ways he can choose the contiguous segments such that the sum of difficulty of each segment is at least ‘K’.

**For example:**
```
Let’s say N = 4, K = 10  and A[] = {‘6’ , ‘1’ , ‘2’ , ‘7’}. 
The contiguous segments {‘6’, ‘1’, ‘2’, ‘7’} and {‘1’, ‘2’, ‘7’} are the only segments having a sum greater than or equal to 10.
```

**Input Format:**
```
First-line contains  ‘T’, denoting the number of Test cases.
For each Test case:
The first line contains a single integer ‘N’ denoting the size of the array.
The second line contains a single integer ‘K’.
The third line contains 'N' space-separated integers denoting the elements of the array ‘A’.
```

**Output Format:**
```
For each test case, you have to print the number of contiguous segments having a sum of at least ‘K’.
```

**Note:**
```
You don’t need to print anything. It has already been taken care of. Just implement the given function.
```

**Constraints:**
```
1 <= ‘T’ <= 5
4 <= ‘N’ <= 10^5
0 <= ‘A[i]’ <= 10^5
1 <= ‘K’ <= 10^5

Time Limit: 1 sec

For test case 1:
    The contiguous segments {‘6’, ‘1’, ‘2’, ‘7’} and {‘1’, ‘2’, ‘7’} are the only segments having a sum greater than or equal to 10.
For test case 2:
    The contiguous segment {‘6’, ‘1’, ‘2’, ‘7’} is the only segment having a sum greater than or equal to 10.

## Ninja And The Strong Subarrays `Difficulty: MEDIUM`

**Problem Statement**

Ninja has been given a digit array ‘A’ of size ‘N’. A digit array contains only digit integers from 0 to 9.

A subarray is strong if the sum of all elements in it is equal to the length of the subarray.

Now, ninja wonders how many strong subarrays are there in an array; your task is to help the ninja to find the number of strong subarrays in an array.

**EXAMPLE:**
```
Input: 'N' = 3, 'A' = [1, 2, 0]

Output: 3

In the given array, subarrays [1], [1, 2, 0] and [2, 0] are strong subarrays.
```

**Input Format:**
```
The first line will contain integer 'T', denoting the number of test cases.

For each test case, the first line will contain an integer 'N', 
the number of digits in an array 'A', and the next line will contain the array elements.
```

**Output Format:**
```
For each test case, print the number of strong subarrays in the given input array.
```

**Note:**
```
You don't need to print anything. It has already been taken care of. Just implement the given function.
```

**Constraints:**
```
1 <= 'T' <= 10
1 <= 'N'<= 10^4
0 <= 'A[i]' <= 9
Time Limit: 1 sec
```

**Sample Input 1:**

```

**Explanation Of Sample Input 1:**

```
For the first test case, there are two strong subarrays [1] from the 
first position and [1] from the last position.

For the second case, there is only one strong subarray [1] from the first position.
```

**Sample Input 2:**
```

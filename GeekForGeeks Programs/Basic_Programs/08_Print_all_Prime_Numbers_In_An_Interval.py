Given two positive integers start and end. 
The task is to write a Python program to 
print all Prime numbers in an Interval.

Definition: A prime number is a natural number 
greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than
 1 and itself. 
The first few prime numbers are {2, 3, 5, 7, 11, â€¦.}.
